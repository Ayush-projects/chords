Set Up the Node.js Server:

Initialize the Project: Create a new Node.js project using npm init, setting up your package.json file.
Install Dependencies: Install necessary packages like express for the server framework, axios for making HTTP requests, and any other required libraries (nodemon for development, cors for handling cross-origin requests).
Configure the Server: Set up an Express server to handle incoming requests. Create endpoints to manage music streaming functionalities.
Authenticate with the Music API:

Obtain API Credentials: Register your application with a music streaming service to get API credentials.
Implement Authentication: Use OAuth 2.0 or other authentication methods to securely access the music streaming API. Handle token retrieval and storage.
Create Backend Endpoints:

Fetch Music Data: Set up routes on your Node.js server to interact with the music API. Create endpoints to search for tracks, fetch playlists, and retrieve song details.
Stream Music: Implement routes that handle streaming music data. These routes will process API responses and send them to the browser extension in a suitable format.
